# Technologies Used
Drink4You was developed using the following technologies:

### C# .NET for backend development
### Entity Framework and Identity for database management
### Microsoft SQL Server for database storage
### React.js for frontend development
### MUI for CSS styling
# Learning Outcomes
Developing Drink4You was a learning experience for me. This project helped me to understand how to create a backend, frontend, and combine them together. I also utilized an external API for drinks, which helped me to learn how to integrate third-party APIs. Furthermore, I gained experience working with Git as I collaborated with one team member to develop the project.

# Installation
To install Drink4You, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the solution file Drink4You.sln in Visual Studio.
Update the database connection string in appsettings.json with your MySQL server information.
Open the Package Manager Console and run the following commands:

Update-Database
Start the backend API by running the project.
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the client folder.
Run the command npm install to install the dependencies.
After the installation is complete, run npm start to start the frontend application.
The website should now be available at http://localhost:3000.

Drink4You is easy to use. When you first access the website, you will be able to see a list of drink categories. You can click on a category to view all the drinks that belong to that category. To view more information about a specific drink, simply click on the drink's image or title. You can also like or add the drink to your favorites.
